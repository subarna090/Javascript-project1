1. Prompt the user for their name.

2. Use a pop-up box to welcome the user by name.

3. Display the current date on the page in the following format: October 30, 2000.  Do not display the time.  Do not "hard code" the date; if I load the page tomorrow, I should get a different date than if I load it today.

4. Display the last modified date of the document.

5. Put some useful advice, on any subject, in the status line of the browser.

6. Display a message saying Good Morning if it is in the morning, Good Afternoon if it is in the afternoon, and Good Evening if it is in the Evening.
